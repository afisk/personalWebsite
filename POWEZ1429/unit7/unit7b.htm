					<td id="text"><p>Here we see a Rider, a forgotten hero in the age-old practice of seahorse racing, now banned in all 50 
					states. Back in the day, proud young men would take their watery stallions to the gates at the lake on Sunday 
					afternoons for run (or swim as it was) in the classiest sport the world has ever known. Beginning in 1784, 
					seahorse racing took off around the turn of the 19th century and peaked in 1873 with more than 1,000,000 
					spectators attending the Grand Slide race on Echo Lake in West Milford, NJ. Unfortunately, this majestic sport
					was banned in 1887 by 15 states after the viscous and gruesome accident in the Gotezets Crown race of 1896 and 
					was banned by the reaming states and territories by 1900 (also banned in Europe).
