	I would have liked to show more of the actual work I do and the items I produce but unfortunately I cannot do so under contract.
	I added a link to the homepage in via the BRB logo in the head section of all pages to make it look more legit. Just to be clear, I combined the email and list
	requirements into the form attribute. Two pages will not validate due to email addresses.
	Maybe this is kind of a boring site but it's supposed to a B2B site, plain, simple, straightforward. I really need to redesign my real site to make it even cleaner. I removed the text decoration
	for bottom links with exception of in-text links.
	Small scale electronics manufacturing is my hobby turned business and it's so much fun to do! It requires good eyesight and a very steady and fast hand to manage the tweezers 
	especially when placing 44qfn packages such as the one on the <a href="products.htm">products page</a>. I'm not sure who the heck spends 12 hours on a simple site like this as 
	cited in your example. I'm more proud of my insane landing than this series of sites and the landing took a fraction of the time!
