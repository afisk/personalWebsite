		"<span class="bold">My Moment</span>" - DJ Drama Feat. 2 Chainz, Meek Mill and Jeremih<br/>
			<div class="text">
			I'm not sure how to explain this song 'cause it's just so good... The background for this track clinches its presence on this list. When combined with the softly autotuned vocals in the hook, DJ Drama mixes a winner. Now if only this song kept playing on the <a href="music/DJ Drama - My Moment (feat. 2 Chainz, Meek Mill and Jeremih).mp3">radio</a>.

		"<span class="bold">Promises</span>" - Nero (Skrillex Remix)<br/>
			<div class="text">
			A rave and dubstep heavyweight, <span class="name">Promises</span> is a killer track in itself. After a soft piano open, Skillex dumps the listener into is populer brostep swings, taking the track to new heights.
