		I’m not sure why I am writing this… I think I’ve run out of good ideas for webpages. 
		Hello Kitty is a classy cat (get the pun??) who goes around enslaving inferior races of 
		animals to be her pets. We all know the soft meowing thing that girls wear on their pink
		shirts and in their hair but little did they know that Hello Kitty is actually just a 
		bad kitty!
