		<h1 id="top" class="first">My Two Favorite Topics</h1>

		<h3 class="first">My two favorite snacks are Cookies and Muffins</h3>

		<ol>
			<li class="first">Cookies<br />
			Cookies are great because there is one for everyone, chocolate 
			chip, blueberry, raspberry, anything can be in a cookie.  Cookies 
			make great gifts and are sure to impress.  EVERYONE LIKES COOKIES.  
			Cookies can be crunchy or soft, small or large.
			Here are 2 websites about Cookies:
				<ul>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/Cookie/CookieTips.htm">Baking Cookies</a></li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="http://facts-about-chocolate.com/history-of-chocolate-chip-cookies/">History of Chocolate Chip Cookies</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Muffins<br />
			A good website about Muffins can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dianasdesserts.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/bakingtips.muffins/muffins.cfm">MuffinTips</a></li>
		</ol>
		
		<p style="font-variant:small-caps;font-weight:bold">Reason: I love snacking on treats, Chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chip Muffins are the BEST</p>

		
		<!--Second two favorites-->
		
		<h3 class="first">My two favorite outdoor activities are Bicycling and Swimming</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li class="first">Bicycling<br />
			Bicycling is a fun outdoor sport, not only because it is good exercise, 
			but it is fun to go fast under your own leg power.  Bicycling can get 
			a person from point a to point b much easier than walking.  
			Here is a good <a target="_blank" href="../images/U6Pics/pic1.jpg">Bicycle</a> picture
			<!--Picture link : https://blurppy.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/1aold_bike_aug_2006.jpg-->
			</li>
			<li>Here are two good Swimming pictures
				<ul>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="../images/U6Pics/pic2.jpg">High Speed Swimming</a></li>
					<li><a target="_blank" href="../images/U6Pics/pic3.jpg">Swimming</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Reason: I like to keep busy during the Summer and Swimming and Bicycling are two great 
		   things that I love to do not only with friends, but by myself as well.</p>
